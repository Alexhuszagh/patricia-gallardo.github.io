<p>
Patricia is a programmer who has worked mostly in C++ and Java.
She has spent her career continuously delivering from the same code-base to a large user base,
from working on two browsers (<a href="https://www.opera.com">Opera</a> and <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a>),
to working on embedded telepresence endpoints for
<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/index.html">Cisco</a>.
She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software architecture,
and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user experiences.
</p>
<p>
Her focus on the end users has led her work more and more toward privacy and security,
and she has recently started her own company, <a href="https://turtlesec.no">TurtleSec</a>,
hoping to contribute positively to the infosec and C++ communities.
She is also involved in the <a href="http://www.includecpp.org">#include&lt;C++&gt;</a>
organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.
