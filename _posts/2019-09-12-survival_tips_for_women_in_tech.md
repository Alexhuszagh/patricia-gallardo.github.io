Being the only woman on your team can be hard. Many times it’s difficult to know what is only your experience and what is common. In this talk we’ll go through 24 tips (and a few bonus tips) based on well over a decade of experience being the only woman in several teams. If you’re a woman hopefully you’ll walk out with some ideas you can put to work right away, if you’re a man hopefully you’ll walk out with a new perspective and start noticing things in your day-to-day that you didn’t notice before.
