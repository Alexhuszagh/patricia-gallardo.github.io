More and more we see technology, both hardware and software, intersect with fundamental issues like privacy, democracy and human rights. The opaqueness of tech makes it a handy instrument of oppression and manipulation. We have taught the population to trust us. We have constructed a world in which they have to exist, with little to no oversight or transparency. We build critical infrastructure on hardware and software that even we cannot audit. How can we wield that responsibility? How do we protect those that speak up? How do we protect the population?
