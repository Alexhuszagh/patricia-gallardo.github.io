Security vulnerabilities and secure coding is often talked about in the abstract by programmers, but rarely understood. In this talk we will walk through a simple exploit, how it’s developed and how it’s used. The goal is to try to get a feeling for the point of view of an "attacker", and to slowly start looking at exploitation as another programming tool. We will mainly be looking at C and x86_64 assembly, so bring snacks.
