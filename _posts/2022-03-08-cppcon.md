Content Warning: Mentions of rape and Child Sexual Abuse Imagery

TL;DR

CppCon leadership and the C++ Foundation board have worked in secret to protect a person convicted of rape and possession of 
Child Sexual Abuse Imagery. They have refused any transparency into a process where they had decided to allow this person
full access to CppCon as an attendee, speaker and trainer. This person is well-known and trusted in the C++ community.

Personal Statement

I never wanted to write this. I am heartbroken that I have to. But I will not stay silent.

I wanted this to come from #include <C++>, but it is clear that we do not have the same objectives here, so I will do
this as me Patricia, not as admin at #include <C++>, a position I might lose as a result of this.

Over the past 4 months we, representatives for #include <C++>, have edited various versions of the following documents.

Maybe #include <C++> will commit to them, maybe they will not. I waited 4 months, and nothing has changed. Some people are
holding out hope for change on the part of CppCon and the C++ Foundation board, but publishing these documents is not a 
threat, it is a step towards transparency and a commitment to actual inclusion. People have a right to make up their own 
mind.

This is not the right time, but honestly, we've been in a global pandemic for years, there was never a right time, and 
time is running out. People are making plans for their year, they need to be able to make informed decisions. I hope 
those decisions involve not supporting CppCon in any way, to signal clearly that we need change.
