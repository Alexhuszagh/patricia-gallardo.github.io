<h2>Secure Programming Practices in C++</h2>

<p>
This talk is for programmers wishing to feel more comfortable navigating the C++ landscape. We will explore the programming culture that has developed around the C++ language. Specifically, we will look at programming patterns that navigate around or through some of the dangerous parts of the C++ language. The goal is to build a set of programming practices based in the “smaller and cleaner language” inside C++. And by doing so, we will also build an awareness around code constructs that can potentially “blows your whole leg off”.
